I built this project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<br/>
<br/>
This is one of the first set of projects I'm making with the use of JavaScript.<br/>
<br/>
So this project is basically what the name says it isðŸ˜…, it plays a sound according to the letter you press or when you click it.<br />
<br />
I built this by implementing my knowledge on functions. I also learnt a lot of things when building this project like learning how to add event listeners to listen to when a key is pressed or when a button is pressed, how to use call back functions and a lot more.<br />
<br />
This project was really fun and I would love to hear your views by messaging me on linkedIn<br />
